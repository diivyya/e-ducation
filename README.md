### 1. Admin Portal
- The admin portal manage data (add,delete,modify) of Faculty staff, students, departments, subjects, T&P cell.
- The admin cannot make another admin (Mandatory access control) because such high privilege (adding/deleting departments) should not be able to get distributed (discretionary)
- A new admin can only be made through the main database.
- The data is pulled dynamically from other collections and used to create new documents.
